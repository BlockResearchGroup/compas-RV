# About

## Welcome to RhinoVAULT

RhinoVAULT is a Rhino plugin for the form-finding of funicular shell structures using the _Thrust Network Analysis_ (TNA) method. Integrating principles of _graphic statics_, RhinoVAULT provides an intuitive and uniquely interactive approach to funicular form-finding, enabling the creation of structurally efficient and expressive shapes while offering insights into the underlying structural behavior.

Originally developed by Dr. Matthias Rippmann at the Block Research Group at ETH Zurich, RhinoVAULT’s current development leverages [COMPAS](https://compas-dev.github.io/), a Python-based framework for computational research and collaboration in architecture, engineering, and digital fabrication. Built with open-source packages from the COMPAS ecosystem, the core functionalities of RhinoVAULT is available not only for Rhino but also any other CAD software or browser with a Python scripting interface.

As a fully open-source tool, RhinoVAULT is accessible to all, supporting students, researchers and design professionals globally in realizing innovative projects. Learning about your projects is invaluable for software development and serves as an inspiration to the structural design community. We invite you to connect with us to share projects created with RhinoVAULT or to explore opportunities for collaborations and workshops.

Happy form finding!
