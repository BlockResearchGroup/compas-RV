The RhinocerosÂ® plug-in RhinoVAULT was originally developed by Dr. Matthias Rippmann at the Block Research Group of ETH Zurich. It emerged from research on _Thrust Network Analysis_ (TNA) and was intended to facilitate the creation and exploration of compression-only, funicular structures.

Based on TNA, RhinoVAULT provides an intuitive method for funicular form finding, adopting advantages of techniques such as graphic statics, but offering a viable extension to fully three-dimensional problems. The designer can control the many degrees of freedom of highly indeterminate three-dimensional equilibrium systems to explore a variety of structural forms.

Since its release in 2014, RhinoVAULT has been downloaded by more than 30.000 people, it was awarded in the category "Structure / Physics Formation" at ALGODeQ, an international competition for algorithmic design programs, and it has been used to design surprising free-form masonry vaults and shell structures all over the world.
