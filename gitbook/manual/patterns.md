# 1. Pattern

The first step of the workflow is to generate the topology of the `FormDiagram`, which is called the `Pattern` in RhinoVAULT. A `Pattern` is a collection of vertices interconnected by lines, represented by the COMPAS [mesh datastructure](https://compas-dev.github.io/main/api/compas.datastructures.html#meshes).

RhinoVAULT offers several methods for generating a `Pattern`. Each method has a direct influence not only on the topology of the eventual shell structure, but also the type of application and interaction that is desired during the design process.&#x20;

## 1a. Create Pattern

There are many ways to generate a topological pattern. Each method has pros and cons, and the desired design or workflow will help determine which method is more appropriate.

In the case of the rib layout variations for the [rib-stiffened funicular floor system](https://block.arch.ethz.ch/brg/research/rib-stiffened-funicular-floor-system), the boundary remains fixed (the footprint and depth of the floor). However, depending on the topology of the form diagram, the distribution and flow of forces change drastically.&#x20;

In RhinoVAULT, three types of Rhino geometries can be used to generate a `Pattern :` Lines, Mesh and Surfaces. These pattern generation features would be particularly useful when there is already an existing structure with a geometry that one would like to recreate the pattern for.

{% hint style="warning" %}
`Pattern` is a COMPAS [mesh](https://compas-dev.github.io/main/api/generated/compas.datastructures.Mesh.html#compas.datastructures.Mesh) object. A mesh datastructure is network of faces, where the connectivities of the faces are defined by halfedge adjacencies.&#x20;


{% endhint %}

### RhinoLines

One of the simplest, and the most manual, way to make the Pattern is to draw the edges of the `Pattern` as Rhino lines. Each edge of the Pattern should be an individual line; all lines should be broken at all line intersections. In other words, these lines may not be overlapping.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/from-lines-grid.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The input set of lines must consist of closed loops of lines representing the faces of the `Pattern.` If there are closed loops of lines, a `Pattern` will be generated and all lines that do not form a closed loop, such as the "leaf" edges will be omitted.

### RhinoMesh

A Rhino mesh object can be used to create a `Pattern`. Since a Pattern is also a mesh object, the vertices and edges can be directly used to create the vertices and edges of the `Pattern`.

### RhinoSurface

A non-trimmed Rhino surface object can be used to create a Pattern, using subdivision values for U and V.

### MeshGrid

This function automatically generates a mesh grid using number and size of the grid in x and y directions.

### Triangulation

Not implemented.
