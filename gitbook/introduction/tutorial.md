In this tutorial, we will use all of the basic RhinoVAULT features to find the equilibrium shape of a simple compression shell with 4 corner supports and unsupported, open boundaries. This tutorial is intended to be a “quick start” guide of the main steps and procedures of the RhinoVAULT workflow. Specific parameters and optional features will not be addressed in detail. We will go through the following steps:

1. Create & Modify Pattern
2. Define Boundary Conditions.
3. Form Diagram
4. Force Diagram
5. Horizontal Equilibrium
6. Vertical Equilibrium
7. Modify Diagrams (skip)
8. Settings
9. Utilities

## 1. Create & Modify Pattern

### 1a. Create Pattern

A `Pattern` is a collection of lines that define the topology of the form diagram. In this tutorial, we will use the `MeshGrid` option to generate a simple 10x10 orthogonal grid. You have the option to choose the size of the mesh and the number of division in x and y axis.

From the RhinoVAULT toolbar, click <img src="../.gitbook/assets/RV_pattern (1).svg" alt="" data-size="line"> or type `RV_pattern` in the command line. From the sub-commands, select `MeshGrid`. From the option prompts that follow, enter through them to keep the default settings. The default settings will create an orthogonal grid that has a dimension of 10 (in current Rhino units) in X and Y directions, with 10 subdivisions in X and Y directions.

### 1b. Modify Pattern

RhinoVAULT provides various mechanisms for modifying the geometry of the `Pattern`, such as moving vertices, changing attributes of vertices and edges, and relaxing. These features will not be covered in this tutorial.&#x20;
