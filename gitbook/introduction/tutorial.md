# Tutorial

In this tutorials, we will use COMPAS RHinoVAULT to find the equilibrium shape
of a simple compression shell with 4 corner supports and unsupported, open boundaries.

We will go through the following steps:

1. Define a force pattern.
2. Define the boundary conditions.
3. Make a form diagram.
4. Make a force diagram.
5. Compute horizontal equilibrium.
6. Compute vertical equilibrium.
