# Legal Terms

### 1. Definition of the Software

RhinoVAULT is a software package for structural form finding using the Thrust Network Approach (TNA) to intuitively create and explore compression-only structures.&#x20;

The “Software” shall be considered the compiled RhinoVAULT plugin to the [Rhinoceros®](https://www.rhino3d.com/) software of Robert McNeel and Associates, Seattle, and the corresponding documentation to RhinoVAULT. For the avoidance of doubt, Rhinoceros® shall not be considered part of RhinoVAULT and/or the Software and it is the LICENSEE’s responsibility to obtain the necessary Rhinoceros® license. Source code shall not be considered part of the Software.

* warranty of accuracy of results, of the quality and performance of the Software

The tool was developed to support the user in the form finding process of vaulted compression structures in the early design phase. It is obvious that prior to any realization of structures based on designs obtained with RhinoVAULT, a detailed structural analysis is necessary.
