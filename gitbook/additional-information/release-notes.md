# Release notes

All official versions of RhinoVAULT get thoroughly tested before release. Since RhinoVAULT consists of many thousand lines of code chances are high that it contains undiscovered bugs. As soon as we become aware of new bugs and errors, they are addressed in the subsequent releases and documented in this section.
